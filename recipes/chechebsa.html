    <h3>Chechebsa, also known as kita firfir, an Ethiopian shredded flat bread fried with spices and butter</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 or 4 tablespoons of clarified butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of berbere</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by mixing the flour with a pinch of salt or wait till it is all cooked and done and sprinkle some salt while you are mixing your pieces of flat bread with the berbere and butter.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, start making a batter by slowly adding water to the flour and mixing it well. The thickness of the kita depends on the thickness of the batter.</li>
            <li>Just be careful to not to make it watery. If you feel it is too thin, just add a little bit more flour. Beat the batter well so it wouldn't have any lumps.</li>
            <li>You can always check the consistence by lifting your beater/stirrer or whatever tool you are using to beat your dough.</li>
            <li>Dress a frying pan with a little oil and heat it to a medium hot.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour your batter onto the hot pan in a thin layer.</li>
            <li>The thiner the layer, the tastier your Chechebsa becomes.</li>
            <li>If you feel you have put too much batter to one side or at the center of the pan, just move the pan side to side or use the back of a spoon to flatten/spread it out.</li>
            <li>Wait two to three minutes and flip the kita so the top gets fried too.</li>
            <li>The light brown spots should be your signals to tell you the kita is fully cooked. Once done frying the kita, put it aside to cool.</li>
        </ol>
