    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Place your saucepan on your stovetop at medium heat. Then place the onions and oil within the saucepan. Continually stir until the onions are slightly brown.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are ready, add in the garlic and tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes are mushy. Add the karia or jalapeño into the saucepan. Leave to cook down for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Grab your can of fava beans and drain out most of the liquid. In a separate bowl, mash the beans with a fork. You want to make sure to get them to look liked mashed beans. If you prefer to have some of the skin of the fava beans in the final product then don't mush them as much. Remember to save 1/2 cup of liquid for later!</li>
        <li>After all the liquid has evaporated in the saucepan, add your mashed beans and 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid. Stir together.</li>
        <li>Add in the salt and Alicha spice(or turmeric) and stir.</li>
